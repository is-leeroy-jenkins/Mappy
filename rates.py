	Purpose:
		Provides a lightweight guard for required runtime values used by Mappy
		utility classes. The function raises clear validation errors for missing
		objects and empty strings before downstream timing, gateway, or service logic
		uses those values.

	Args:
		name: Name of the argument being validated.
		value: Runtime value to validate.

	Raises:
		ValueError: Raised when ``value`` is ``None`` or an empty string.

	Purpose:
		Provides lightweight request throttling for Google Maps and related API
		wrappers. The limiter tracks call count, last request time, elapsed time
		between calls, and total sleep time so service gateways can pause between
		outbound requests without depending on a heavier scheduler.

	Attributes:
		query_per_second: Maximum allowed query rate for the current process.
		interval: Minimum seconds required between successive requests.
		last: Timestamp of the previous completed wait operation.
		now: Timestamp captured during the current wait operation.
		delta: Elapsed seconds since the prior wait operation.
		calls: Number of times the limiter has been invoked.
		total_sleep: Total seconds slept across all wait operations.
